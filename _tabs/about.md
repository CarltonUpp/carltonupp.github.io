Hello! My name is Carlton Upperdine, and I am a
Software Engineer currently based in the UK. Throughout my career I have worn many hats, having worked in technical
capabilities such as Software Engineering, QA, SRE/DevOps, Agile
Delivery and more recently as a Consultant.

I started out my career in the .NET/Microsoft space, but in recent
years I have had the opportunity to work in a more tech agnostic way
and have gained experience with languages such as Java, TypeScript and
Go.

Here you will find my writings about things I have learned over the years, as well as the occasionally more thought-provoking pieces. If you want to connect, please don't hesitate to get in touch on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/carltonupp) or [X/Twitter](https://x.com/carltonupp).
