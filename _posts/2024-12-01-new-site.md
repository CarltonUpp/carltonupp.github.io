## A Fresh Start  

It’s been almost a year since I last posted. Time has flown, but so much has happened!

I got married, went on an amazing honeymoon, and just recently landed an exciting new position at work. I’ll save the details on that for later, but let’s just say it’s been mental.

With the new year on the horizon, I’m getting the itch to write again- though I want to do a few things differently. Instead of relying on one of the countless platforms out there, I’ve decided to take full control of my content and host it in markdown files.

With so many writing platforms going under or adopting heavy-handed monetisation strategies lately, I’ve started to worry about losing my work. That’s why I’ve returned to my very first solution: **GitHub Pages**! I’ve managed to salvage a ton of content I’ve written over the years and pulled it all together in one place. From now on, this will be where you find my writing online. I might still share the occasional post on LinkedIn if it feels right, but this will be the go-to spot for everything I write.  

## Why Writing Matters to Me  

1. **I really enjoy it.** Writing is one of the best ways for me to solidify my understanding of a topic—and honestly, it’s just fun.  
2. **It’s time to focus on building my personal brand.** Yes, I know— just saying “personal brand” makes me sound like a bit of a wanker. But let’s face it: in this industry, having a strong network and a clear voice is more important than ever.  
3. **It’s super convenient.** There have been so many times I’ve referenced an old blog post during a work conversation or even at a social event. It saves time, and frankly, I express myself better in writing than I do off the cuff.  

## My Plans for the Future  

I’m setting a realistic goal for myself: starting in January, I’m committing to at least one post per month. I’d love to post more often, but one a month feels like a manageable starting point.  

In the past, I’ve mostly focused on technical “how-to” articles. Those aren’t going anywhere—I’ll still write them—but I also want to branch out and try my hand at longer-form content. Improving my writing skills is something that’ll help me in all areas of life, and challenging myself with deeper, more thoughtful pieces feels like the next step.  

Finally, my new position at work has me diving into some really exciting technologies. Writing about what I’m learning will be a great way to solidify my own understanding, and hopefully, it’ll be helpful for others too.  

In the meantime, if you want to connect with me or read some of my content in short form- I am available on all the usual platforms with the handle `@carltonupp`.

So, here’s to fresh starts and new beginnings. See you in January!
