I recently finished reading *Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment* by Jason Schreier[^4], which documents the history of Blizzard Entertainment. The book was a compelling read — proven by the fact that I actually finished it. As a serial book abandoner, this is high praise. For someone like myself, who grew up playing *World of Warcraft* and countless other Blizzard titles, it was a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at how some of my favourite games came together and the challenges the company overcame along the way.

It wasn’t all a happy trip down memory lane. Anybody who has been following the news in recent years will know that Blizzard has been no stranger to controversy and even legal action[^1]. From workplace misconduct lawsuits to fan backlash over monetisation practices, the company’s reputation has taken a hit. A key part of Schreier’s story was the tenuous relationship with their parent company, Activision, and its CEO, Bobby Kotick.

To summarise a long story, Activision — and by extension, Kotick — were growing frustrated with Blizzard’s unwillingness to ship more frequently and ultimately make more money from their extremely loyal fanbase. Blizzard, on the other hand, didn’t want to compromise on their core ethos of releasing high-quality products only when they were ready. Releasing content annually, regardless of quality, was not the Blizzard way, and this created significant friction between the two organisations.

## Missionaries and Mercenaries

In circa 2000, John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins - one of the most influential venture capital firms on the planet, wrote about what he saw as the two types of internet entrepreneur[^2]. He described the two camps as missionaries and mercenaries. Missionaries are guided by purpose and their values- and view their endeavour as a marathon instead of as a sprint. Mercenaries on the other hand are motivated by the end result and seek to get there as fast as possible.

This framework isn’t just limited to tech startups; it applies across industries, from gaming to entertainment companies. Organisations often struggle to strike a balance between these two approaches, and this tension can define their successes and failures.

When applying this understanding towards the Activision Blizzard situation, it’s relatively easy to see which side is which and very tempting to place these into the good guys and the bad guys. Although mercenaries often carry a negative connotation, they bring strengths to the table just as missionaries have their blind spots.

## The problem with missionaries
Blizzard has developed a strong, values-driven culture over its 30-year history, and these values are at the core of everything that they do. These values are as follows:

* Gameplay First
* Commit to Quality
* Play Nice; Play Fair
* Embrace Your Inner Geek
* Every Voice Matters
* Learn & Grow
* Think Globally
* Lead Responsibly

These principles have not only defined Blizzard’s culture but also underpinned its ability to create games that resonate with millions worldwide. It’s difficult to argue with any of these individually, and values like this have clearly worked long-term, given the massive successes of titles such as *World of Warcraft* and *Overwatch*. However, it is possible for an organisation to become blinded by past successes or hide behind vague value statements to oppose decisions they don’t like.

Blizzard prides itself on giving teams a great deal of autonomy, which has served it well in some respects, but the organisation had also grown massively inefficient in places. Some long-term staff had become set in their ways, and changes were met with heavy resistance in the spirit of protecting the “Blizzard Way.”

A good example of this is that Blizzard would rarely discuss financials during game development meetings. To them, these details were an afterthought and had no place in how a game was designed. Blizzard was, and will always be, a commercial endeavour, so how it makes money is absolutely crucial to the company’s long-term success.

Activision, on the other hand, are highly successful at monetising their products and serving their customer base. The company has not missed an annual *Call of Duty* release since 2005 and has enjoyed near-constant revenue growth throughout its history. While Blizzard focused on creativity and quality, Activision honed its expertise in consistent output and financial growth. In that respect, you can’t argue with the results.

## The case for mercenaries
Mercenaries excel at meeting their goals. Whether that goal is consistent revenue growth, achieving dominance in a market, or even just becoming valuable enough for a profitable acquisition, a mercenary will make every decision in the spirit of achieving it.

In the age of conscious capitalism, where companies are encouraged to consider the ethics, sustainability, and purpose of their actions[^5], it is easy for organisations to become distracted from their primary goal of making money. Companies can become bloated and inefficient, with priorities being placed in the wrong areas.

For example, despite *Overwatch* being one of Blizzard’s most profitable divisions, it had a comparatively smaller number of people assigned to it than divisions such as *World of Warcraft* or *Diablo*. A reason behind this was the insistence of game director Jeff Kaplan to personally onboard each new team member. While a noble endeavour, it simply does not scale beyond a certain level. Activision had thousands of developers working on each new *Call of Duty* release, whereas Blizzard had an average of just 50 working on *Overwatch*[^3].

The suggestion from Activision was to massively increase the number of people working on this product. *Overwatch* was the first new property from the company in 18 years and was released to widespread critical acclaim. The company had captured lightning in a bottle, and Activision believed that Blizzard should be capitalising on it as they had with *World of Warcraft*. Instead, the company had teams of people working on passion projects that simply weren’t gaining any traction, such as the various failures to create an FPS set in the *Starcraft* universe.


## In Summary
The interplay between missionaries and mercenaries within organisations like Blizzard and Activision highlights the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches. Missionaries, with their deep commitment to values and long-term vision, can create exceptional products that resonate deeply with audiences. However, without a clear focus on commercial realities, even the most beloved companies risk stagnation or inefficiency.

On the other hand, mercenaries bring a sharp focus on goals and profitability, ensuring organisations remain competitive and adaptable in ever-changing markets. Their approach may lack the emotional connection and passion-driven ethos of missionaries, but their results are undeniable.

Ultimately, the ideal organisation finds a balance between these two mindsets — preserving the creativity and purpose-driven philosophy of the missionary while leveraging the discipline and strategic acumen of the mercenary. For companies like Blizzard, which operate at the intersection of art and commerce, this balance is essential not just for their survival, but for their ability to thrive in a demanding industry.

So, can gaming companies strike the right balance, or will they always lean too far one way? Perhaps the answer lies in learning from both philosophies.
