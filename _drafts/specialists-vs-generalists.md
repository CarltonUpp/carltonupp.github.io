Deciding whether or not to specialise is a crucial decision in one's career.

In the era of the full-stack engineer being the norm, I’ve noticed that many people have shied away from developing deep knowledge in one specific area, opting instead for a broader skillset. However, there is still a significant group of individuals who argue that specialising in one area is key to maximising both career growth and earning potential.

In my view, the decision to specialise should be based on several factors. In this article, I will outline what I believe are the key considerations before making such an important choice. For the purposes of this discussion, I will refer to the two sides as *specialists* and *generalists*.

## Specialists

A specialist is best described as someone with deep knowledge in a specific area. If you’ll indulge me with a slightly geeky metaphor, a specialist is like an RPG character who maxes out a single stat, such as Intelligence or Strength, at the expense of other attributes.

Some examples of areas in which people specialise include:

- **Platforms**: AWS, Azure, GCP, Salesforce, SAP
- **Domains**: Finance, defence, or Web3
- **Disciplines**: Front-end, data engineering, or embedded systems
- **More niche areas**: Performance, accessibility, or legacy code migrations

Specialists excel in the obscure and specific. They’re often the go-to person for solving niche problems. For example, I once worked with a developer we’ll call *Dave*.

Dave was an absolute powerhouse when it came to squeezing performance improvements out of .NET. What he didn’t know about memory allocation and CPU cycles simply wasn’t worth knowing, and he was the go-to person for optimising our code.

But specialising has its downsides. A specialist’s expertise is only valuable if it’s in demand. A niche skill that no one needs won’t be sustainable in the long term.

Specialists are also typically less well-rounded. Remember Dave? What I didn’t mention about him was that his code was unreadable to anyone but him, and he was a complete disaster when asked to do anything related to front-end work. Luckily for Dave, he now works as an independent consultant, making a fortune and is far removed from writing any CSS.

## Generalists

On the other hand, a generalist casts a wide net, exploring different domains, technologies, and sometimes even roles. Generalists are adaptable and thrive in dynamic environments. Think of them as the RPG character who distributes points evenly across all stats.

Generalists are the quintessential *jack-of-all-trades, master of none*. They’re a safe bet for any team, filling in gaps and adapting to whatever is required. For example, in a team full of backend developers, a generalist might take on front-end tasks or help with deployment pipelines.

However, generalists have their limits. No one can know everything, and when it comes to deeply specialised problems, they can fall short. I fall into this category myself, and while I’m a solid all-rounder, I’m hopeless at performance tuning—no matter how much Dave tried to teach me.

## Being T-Shaped

A common middle ground in the debate about specialising is the *T-shaped skillset*. A T-shaped skillset involves having deep expertise in one area (the vertical stroke of the T) while maintaining broad, shallow knowledge in adjacent areas (the horizontal stroke).

For example, a backend developer might specialise in Python but have basic knowledge of React for the UI and Kubernetes for infrastructure. This balance allows for flexibility while still offering deep expertise where it’s most needed.

To return to the RPG metaphor, think of it as maxing out Strength but picking up just enough Dexterity to avoid tripping over your own feet in battle.

The industry has been trending toward T-shaped skillsets for years, and it’s often a safe bet for professionals who are not yet ready to make long-term decisions.

## Deciding Between Specialising and Generalising

So, should you specialise or generalise? Like most tech debates, the answer is, unsurprisingly, *it depends*. Let’s break it down.

### Long-Term Career Goals

Consider where you see yourself in 10-20 years.

- If your goal is to become an architect, move into management, or work at startups or smaller companies, being a generalist is often the better choice. These roles require breadth, adaptability, and a holistic view of systems.
- If you’re drawn to consulting or want to work in highly specialised domains (e.g., high-frequency trading), specialising is the way to go. Deep expertise is essential in these fields.

### Level of Experience

Your career stage plays a crucial role in deciding your path:

- **Starting Out**: Focus on learning one language or area well. Listing five languages on your CV with only surface-level knowledge won’t impress employers.
- **Early Career (0–5 Years)**: Explore as many areas as interest you. Say “yes” to opportunities—it’s the best way to learn how systems come together.
- **Senior Level and Beyond**: By this stage, you’ve likely gained enough experience to determine what aligns with your long-term goals. But don’t rush—promotions tend to slow down after the senior level, so it’s fine to take your time figuring things out.

## Wrapping Up

To summarise:

- Specialists and generalists both have their place in the tech ecosystem.
- Specialists thrive in niche areas but risk being overly narrow.
- Generalists are versatile but can struggle with deep, specialised problems.
- A T-shaped skillset offers the best of both worlds and is a solid career strategy for many.

Ultimately, the right choice depends on your long-term goals and career stage. The good news? Your path isn’t set in stone—you can evolve, pivot, and adapt as your career progresses.

So, what path are you on? Are you a specialist, a generalist, or somewhere in between? I’d love to hear your thoughts!
